          This map is made of people. Each dot is a person, and the people are
          organized by similarity. It's like soylent green but with more
          famousness.
        </Folio>

        <Folio hash="bwzI">
          The biggest level of organization is about occupation.
        </Folio>

        <Folio hash="t32w" zoom={{ x: [-50, 50], y: [-50, 50] }}>
          Wikipedia *loves* sports. Athletes are about 50% of all people in
          Wikipedia, and occupy the entire bottom of the map.
        </Folio>

        <Folio hash="eXxy" zoom={{ x: [-18, 52], y: [5, 52] }}>
          About one in seven of the people on Wikipedia play soccer *alone*.
          Among soccer players, the sub-organization is by country.
        </Folio>

        <Folio hash="Cofv" zoom={{ x: [-32, 45], y: [-47, 32] }}>
          But categories aren't perfect -- we can't distinguish in the
          occupational categories between players of **American** football (
          where athletes compete not to kick a ball but to see who can take the
          most traumatic brain injuries for the team ) and players of soccer
          football.
        </Folio>

        <Folio hash="lnWe" zoom={{ x: [-32, 45], y: [-47, 32] }} duration={300}>
          This is a case where Atlas's semantic filters can help. Let's embed
          everything by vector similarity to a sentence about American football.
          {'>'} A player of football who runs up and down the gridiron with the
          pigskin. Hike! Like Tom Brady. The red dots are the most similar, and
          the yellow the least.
        </Folio>

        <Folio hash="iQBh" zoom={{ x: [-32, 45], y: [-47, 32] }} duration={300}>
          Conversely, comparing to the sentence:
          {'>'} A player of football who kicks and scores, drawing penalties and
          red cards like Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi. We get almost
          opposte results.
        </Folio>

        <Folio hash="mnJh" zoom={{ x: [-40, 45], y: [-47, 42] }}>
          We can position by those two axes -- the "American" axis on the x axis
          and the "Soccer" axis on the y -- to use these arbitrary sentences to
          partition between the two sports. The farther to the right is US
          football; to the top is soccer. The green to the lower right in this
          vector space are the Americans once again. The partition is clean, but
          not completely clear; some people fall in between.
        </Folio>

        <Folio hash="jbcl" zoom={{ x: [-5, 10], y: [-20, -15] }}>
          You don't need embeddings to take advantage of Atlas's powerful
          filters! Look at Europe, colored by region.
        </Folio>

        <Folio hash="rxzQ" zoom={{ x: [-5, 10], y: [-20, -15] }}>
          Let's color by people born since 1945. You can clearly see the nations
          of Europe.
        </Folio>

        <Folio hash="Vtu2" zoom={{ x: [-5, 10], y: [-20, -15] }}>
          Let's color by people born between 1870 and 1945. These are the old
          borders, with the German empire and fuzzier nationalities in Eastern
          Europe.
        </Folio>

        <Folio hash="t6J0" zoom={{ x: [-5, 10], y: [-20, -15] }}>
          When you move to where the people die, the definition increases.
