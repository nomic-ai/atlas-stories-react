# Atlas Stories React Component Library

This library distributes components to embed stories into a React app from maps made in [Nomic Atlas](https://atlas.nomic.ai).

Please go to https://github.com/nomic-ai/atlas-stories-examples for how to use these components, and an example React website.

The code and demo site here is primarily for contribution and testing purposes.
